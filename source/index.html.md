# Introduction

Welcome to the Gamelive API!

This Documentation describes how to use our API to create awesome liverooms.

General concepts:
A user needs to be registered in order to create a room. He then becomes admin of this room.
The Room model describes the state of a public room, including its customization.
The Liveroom model describes a room being live, i.e. a websocket is on to update the information (questions, timers...) to all the connected users.

A user entering a room "joins" this room and is then connected to the Liveroom.

An example is available is available here: dev.gamelive.gg

# Authentication

Endpoints having the notice
<aside class="notice">Requires auth token</aside>
require an auth token to be passed as parameter.

```shell

curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
